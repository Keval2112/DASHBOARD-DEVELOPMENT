# Project Description: HR Dashboard — Full Insights for Workforce Analysis
In this project, I designed and developed an interactive HR dashboard to provide comprehensive insights into the organization’s workforce. The dashboard visualizes key HR metrics to support data-driven decision-making regarding promotions, retrenchment, job satisfaction, and overtime.

### Key Components
Total Employees: Displays overall headcount and gender distribution (e.g., 60% male, 40% female).
Promotions & Retrenchments: Visualized by department (Research & Development, Sales, Human Resources).
Job Satisfaction: Bar chart showing employee distribution by satisfaction level (High, Medium, Low).
Overtime Analysis: Pie chart showing proportion of employees working overtime.
Job Role Summary: Tabular view of employee count, promotion eligibility, and retrenchment due by role.


### Tools & Technologies
Tool: Power BI  
Data visualization best practices: clear navigation, color coding, interactive elements
User-focused design for HR stakeholders

### What I Learned
✅ How to structure dashboards for executive-level insights
